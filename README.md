### Deploying a react app on firebase 
1. create a git repo and a repo on local with react project in it and link both 
2. run npm run build on terminal 

#### Set up firebase hosting 
1. Install Firebase CLI
To host your site with Firebase Hosting, you need the Firebase CLI (a command line tool).

> Run the following npm command to install the CLI or update to the latest CLI version.
```bash 
npm install -g firebase-tools
```

>> project will be hosted on a public folder called build in firebase. make sure you don't overwrite the builds.
- The last question is whether or not to overwrite your existing build/index.htmlfile. So You'll want to enter N (No) for this option because we want actual index.html file that Reacts is generated while creating the build.

>> Deploy React app
Now that everything is set up, you can go ahead and deploy your app! The only thing you need to do is run the following command:
```bash 
firebase deploy
```
